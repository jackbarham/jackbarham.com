    '<p>Alerts to RSS was a joint project between myself and Peter Flood. Our aim was to build an application to replace the lost functionality of sending Google Search Alerts to an RSS reader when Google shut down Google Reader.</p><p>We developed this fully responsive application as a side project over two months. I worked on wire-framing, design, front-end development (HTML5, CSS3, LESS and jQuery) and marketing while Pete developed the back-end in Python/Django.</p><p>Just as we were about to launch in private beta, Google reinstated the service and there was no point in us continuing with our project.</p>',
