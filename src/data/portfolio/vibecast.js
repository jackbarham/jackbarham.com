    '<p><a title="Vibecast - The website builder designed for DJs" href="https://www.vibecast.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vibecast</a> is a website builder designed for DJs. Built by myself (also a DJ) as a side-project for others in the music industry, Vibecast enables artists to create a sleek, modern website in minutes without any technical knowledge.</p><p>Offering complete and unrivalled simplicity, Vibecast is the only website builder to include a customisable template, fluid functionality and all the features required by DJs to showcase their talents.</p><p>I planned, prototyped, designed, developed (front and end-end) and deployed Vibecast myself between freelance work. The marketing website is a Vue.js SPA served on AWS S3 & CloudFront which connects to the Vibecast API server for user registration.</p><p>In April 2021, I sold Vibecast.
