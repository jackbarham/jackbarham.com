  copy: '<p>McDonald\'s Monopoly game is a sales promotion run by fast food restaurant chain <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/gb/en-gb.html" target="_blank">McDonald\'s</a>, with a theme based on the Hasbro board game Monopoly.</p><p>I worked on the UK 2021 Mcdonald\'s Monopoly campaign via <a href="https://themarketingstore.com" target="_blank">The Marketing Store</a>. </p><p>I built a single web-based responsive application using the Vue.js framework. The product was available via any web browser and embedded in the My McDonalds native mobile applications using a web-view wrapper which felt like a native app experience.</p><p>Estimations suggest over four million user sessions during the short six week UK-wide campaign.</p><p>I also worked on smaller campaigns and internal products.</p>',
