    '<p>Based at QVC UK headquarters, I came up with concepts for the redesign of part of QVC&#8217;s website including a new live TV section for the launch of two web TV channels in addition to their two existing terrestrial channels.</p><p>I also developed the new designs into front-end templates for prototyping and testing, and helped to develop a new TV player to increase image quality and usability for each of the live TV streams.</p>',
